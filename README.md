# Gaslight Apprenticeship Challenge - edited for MKM Submission

Welcome to the Gaslight Apprenticeship challenge. Your mission, should you choose to accept
it, is to build a shopping list application using React. This repo is based on [this excellent React book and tutorial](http://survivejs.com/webpack_react/introduction/). It should have everything you need to build a basic React application. We highly encourage you, if you are new to React (which is fine, I am too!) to follow this tutorial and build the example application.

## Getting started

...do the following:

```
npm install
npm run start
```

This should build all the code in the application and start a server listening on port 8080. ...This will mean your environment is set up correctly and you are ready to start coding! - Score! Let's get going!

## The App

We'd like you to build a basic application. It should have the following features:

1. Begin a Journey - A journey should ask for your name, and start you off at Bag End
2. You should be able to add mileage
3. Upon addition, the app should update the total mileage, miles to next note and next major milestone, the last entry info and the note as appropriate
4. You should be able to undo the last entry if in error

## Criteria

Impress us! We value code that is simple and easy to understand, as well as an application that works. We don't have any expectations that you have a server portion to this application, but if you're able to get these features implemented and want to stretch yourself/impress us more, here are some things you could try:

### Test your code
If testing isn't something you've seen much of yet, it's one of the first things we'll focus on during your apprenticeship. There's a section in the tutorial we refer to on Testing React. Looking this over and applying it would definitely make you stand out from a crowded field :)

### Store your progress
There are options like [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/libraries/react/) that would allow you to persist the users progress in the cloud. That might be fun!

### Add features
Think of other things this app could use - statistics and graphs definitely.

## Submitting the finished application

Once you've built your application, "send us a link to a github repo with instructions for how to get your app up and running".
